mandolin

=========

slices up gherkin to make it more versatile

gherkin is great but tests (scenarios) are mixed up with the data used for the tests

mandolin can do the following:
    strip out tables and place each one in a pipe separated file
    merge a feature file (containing table placeholders) with a set of pipe separated data files

to do:
allow files to be used from other directories

remove variables and place them in some sort of structure which can be managed
