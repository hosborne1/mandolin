mandolin
=========

slices up gherkin to make it more versatile

gherkin is great but scenarios have embedded data used for the testing

mandolin can do the following:
    strip out tables and place each one in a pipe separated file
    
    merge a feature file (containing table placeholders) with a set of pipe separated data files

to do:
allow files to be used from other directories
